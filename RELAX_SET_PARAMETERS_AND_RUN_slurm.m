%% RELAX_SET_PARAMETERS_AND_RUN:

%% This pipeline firstly filters your data, then deletes bad electrodes and marks extremely bad periods for exclusion from further processing.
%% It then creates a mask of clean and artifact data specific to the length of your data file, which is submitted to a multiple weiner filter (MWF) in order to clean your data.
%% The MWF cleaned data is then submitted to an independent component analysis, and artifactual components detected by ICLabel are cleaned by wavelet enhanced ICA.
%% The resulting saved files are continuous, very well cleaned of artifacts, while still preserving the neural signal.
%% Note that the pipeline will only work on continuous data.

% RELAX is intended to be fully automated, using the most empirical approaches
% we could find in order to identify periods of EEG data containing
% artifacts, as well as removing channels that are either bad, or contain
% above a specified threshold for the proportion of epochs containing
% muscle artifacts.

% In order to use this script, do the following:

% 1) Install the dependencies listed below, and define the folder where
% they are installed (where required)

% 2) Load the "to be processed" files into a single folder, EEGLAB
% formatted (.set format), and specify this folder location in RELAX_cfg.myPath
% (these files should have triggers recoded to reflect participant accuracy
% if desirable, and not have been re-referenced or have any other
% pre-processing completed yet).

% 3) Specify the parameters in RELAX_cfg. These parameters let you determine
% a range of factors that influence the mask creation, eg. "how many 
% epochs can show muscle activity in a channel before that channel  is
% deleted" (note that a maximum of 20% of channel deletions are allowed 
% after the PREP electrode deletion, "what is the maximum proportion of 
% epochs that can be masked as an artifact for each type of artifact", 
% "should I run the MWF twice or just once", and "what is the threshold 
% of artifact severity,  above which sections are marked as an artifact, 
% below which they are not?". 
% Additionally, particular artifact detection and masking functions
% could be excluded if you're not concerned about those artifacts by
% commenting that function out (adding a % symbol at the start of the
% line). For example, you might only want to include muscle, and
% drift artifacts in the MWF cleaning, and not blink and horizontal 
% eye movements if you are analysing eyes closed resting data.

% 4)Click "Run" in the menu up the top of this script
% The script will then process all participants, taking ~10 min per participant. 
% You can run just a subset of the participants first by altering the
% following line: "for FileNumber=1:numel(RELAX_cfg.files)"

% 5) The script will produce files that contain cleaning quality values for
% relevant processes in this script. Means, SD's (or medians and MADs) 
% and ranges across all participants can be examined to determine 
% the success of the script for the study as a whole, and to identify
% potential issues with specific files (eg. the artifact to residue ratio
% is ~1, suggesting artifacts weren't removed successfully, or >75% of the
% epochs contained muscle activity, suggesting bad data throughout). These
% statistics should be reported in publications.

% Note that it's particularly important to check for files that show rank
% deficiency in the MWF processing, as this could prevent the data from
% being cleaned. If this happens, I've found that adjusting the RELAX_cfg
% parameters can fix the problem. Particularly the amount of data that can
% be included in the mask (the mask needs to contain both enough artifact
% and enough clean data to create artifact and clean templates), and the
% minimum length of a marked patch of clean or artifact data (if
% patches are too short, the MWF can't create an adequate mask. The amount
% of data marked as artifact around eye blinks can particularly affect
% this).

% 6) The script will produce output EEG files that have been cleaned into a
% folder labelled 1xMWF for the first run, 2xMWF, and 3xMWF (if
% you select to save these). Cleaned data will be saved into the Cleaned_data 
% folder. The cleaned files will have electrodes removed, and are referenced to the 
% average reference. From this point, I would interpolate missing electrodes, 
% re-code the task related triggers as to whether the participant
% was correct or not, epoch the data, reject epochs that still show artifacts 
% (the epoch rejection wrapper could be adapted to achieve this)
% and separate different conditions into different files in preparation 
% for analysis.

% Note that if you have very large files (or your computer doesn't have much RAM),
% the MWF cleaning may run out of RAM (and suggest a created array is too large).
% This could be addressed by downsampling the data, or reducing 
% RELAX_cfg.MWFDelayPeriod=8; to 4-5. This will reduce the number of samples 
% that the MWF cleaning takes into account when characterising artifacts, 
% but still cleans very effectively.

% Note that the pipeline does not work well on MATLAB versions <2016,
% we suggest updating to a more recent version of MATLAB if your version is
% pre-2016.

% (applies the higher value out of this value and the
% RELAX_cfg.ExtremeVoltageShiftThreshold above as the
% threshold, which caters for the fact that blinks don't affect
% the median, so without this, if data is clean and blinks are
% large, blinks can get excluded as extreme outliers)

% The following selections determine how many epochs of each type of
% artifact to include in the MWF mask (for if you are applying MWF cleaning).
% It is not obvious what the best choices are.

% I have selected as defaults the parameters that work best for our data.
% If only performing one MWF run, perhaps including all artifacts in the mask
% is best (as long as that leaves enough clean data for the clean data
% mask). Somers et al. (2018) suggest that it doesn't hurt to
% include clean data in the artifact mask, and so it's helpful to have wide
% boundaries around artifacts. 

% However, I wonder if some files might include the majority of trials in the artifact
% mask, which could mean that most of the task related ERPs might be considered
% artifacts, and cleaned out from the data. Including ERP trials in the clean
% mask reduces this issue, as the clean mask defines what the good
% data should look like, and if it has ERPs, then the artifact periods will
% be cleaned of only the difference between the clean mask and the artifact
% mask, leaving the ERP in the data. This relies upon a consistent
% ERP across both the clean and artifact masks however. An alternative fix
% could be to implement NaNs (which the MWF mask ignores) over ERP periods
% instead of marking them as artifacts, so the ERP is not included in the
% artifact mask, but this would mean any artifacts that are present in the
% ERPs but not outside the ERP periods aren't cleaned.
            
% Clean periods that last for a shorter duration than the following value to be marked as artifacts, 
% and pad short artifact periods out into artifact periods of at least the following length when 
% they are shorter than this value to reduce rank deficiency issues in MWF cleaning). 
% Note that it's better to include clean periods in the artifact mask rather than the including artifact in the clean mask.
RELAX_cfg.MinimumArtifactDuration=1200; % in ms. It's better to make this value longer than 1000ms, as doing so will catch diminishing artifacts that aren't detected in a neighbouring 1000ms period, which might still be bad
RELAX_cfg.MinimumBlinkArtifactDuration=800; % blink marking is based on the maximum point of the blink rather than the 1000ms divisions for muscle artifacts, so this can be shorter than the value above (blinks do not typically last >500ms)

RELAX_cfg.MWF_delay_spacing_for_muscle_artifacts=2; % set how sparsely the delay stacking is spread when cleaning muscle activity.
% this interacts with the MWFDelayPeriod: the MWFDelayPeriod sets
% how many consecutive samples before and after each timepoint are included 
% in the MWF model (so for example, MWFDelayPeriod = 12 will include 25
% timepoints, with 12 before and 12 after each timepoint included in the
% model). The MWF_delay_spacing sets how sparsely each of the consecutive
% samples are spread. So for example, MWF_delay_spacing = 5 and 
% MWFDelayPeriod = 5 will mean that the MWF cleaning will characterise 5
% separate timepoints before and after each timepoint, with each timepoint 
% separated by 5 samples, for a total of 55 timepoints. Our informal
% testing suggests that a delay period of 8 and a delay spacing of 16 is
% optimal for addressing eye movement artifacts when data are sampled at 
% 1000Hz, possibly reflecting that characterising ~300ms of the data is
% optimal for modelling and cleaning the slower blink activity. In contrast,
% our informal tests showed that for muscle artifacts, a delay spacing of 2 
% and a delay period of ~12 seems best when data are sampled at 1000Hz 
% is better due to the higher frequency nature of muscle artifacts.

%% Notes on the above parameter settings:
% OnlyIncludeTaskRelatedEpochs: this means the MWF cleaning templates 
% won't be distracted by potential large artifacts outside of task related
% periods. However, it also may mean that event related periods are
% included in the artifact template (to be removed). If artifact masks land
% disproportionately around triggers (or certain types of triggers), my
% sense is that all the EEG activity time locked to that trigger will be
% considered an artifact and filtered out by the MWF (including ERPs),
% potentially reducing your ERP for example. An alternative solution to
% this would be to record a sufficient amount of activity before / after
% the task related activity, which includes all the same artifacts as
% within the task, but also a sufficient amount of clean data. Then use
% this data to create the artifact masks (then perhaps marking the task 
% related data as only either clean, or NaNs if they contain artifacts
% (which will be cleaned but aren't thought of as artifacts for the
% artifact template). This would prevent the ERP activity of interest from
% being included in the artifact tempalte (and potentially cleaned)

% MuscleSlopeThreshold: (-0.31 = data from paralysed participants showed no
% independent components with a slope value more positive than this (so
% excluding slopes above this threshold means only excluding data that we
% know must be influenced by EMG). Using -0.31 as the threshold means
% possibly leaving low level EMG data in, and only eliminating the data we
% know is definitely EMG)
% (-0.59 is where the histograms between paralysed ICs and EMG ICs cross,
% so above this value contains a very small amount of the brain data, 
% and over 50% of the EMG data. Above this point, data is more likely to be
% EMG than brain)
% (-0.72 is the maximum of the histogram of the paralysed IC data, so
% excluding more positive values than this will exclude most of the EMG
% data, but also some brain data).
